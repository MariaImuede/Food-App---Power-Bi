## Problem Statement

The food app seeks to analyze user engagement, demographics, spending behavior, and preferences to identify key trends and insights that can inform decision-making processes and enhance the app's performance.

### Steps followed 


Step 1: Open Power BI Desktop and select "Get Data" from the Home tab. Choose the relevant data source (e.g., Excel, CSV) containing the food app data. Navigate to the location of the file and select it to import the data into Power BI.

Step 2: Once the data is imported, Power BI will display a preview of the data. Review the data structure and perform any necessary data cleaning tasks in the Query Editor, such as removing duplicates, handling missing values, and transforming data types as needed.

Step 3: In the Query Editor, profile the data to gain insights into key metrics such as user engagement, demographics, spending behavior, and preferences. Use filters and aggregations to analyze the data and identify trends and patterns.

Step 4: Create visualizations by selecting fields from the Fields pane and dragging them onto the canvas. Choose appropriate visualization types (e.g., bar charts, pie charts, tables) to represent the analyzed data effectively and facilitate insights discovery.

Step 5: Customize visualizations and dashboards to present key insights in a clear and concise manner. Add titles, labels, and legends to provide context and enhance readability. Arrange visualizations on the canvas to create a logical flow of information.

Step 6: Incorporate interactive features such as slicers, filters, and drill-down capabilities to allow users to explore the data dynamically. Add slicers for fields like user demographics (e.g., marital status, age group) and user preferences (e.g., discount usage) to enable targeted analysis.

Step 7: Use calculated measures and KPIs to quantify key metrics and performance indicators relevant to the food app's objectives. Create measures to calculate metrics such as total revenue, average spending per user, engagement duration, and discount participation rates.

Step 8: Validate insights and findings by cross-referencing data from different visualizations and exploring relationships between variables. Conduct thorough analysis to identify correlations and causal relationships that can inform actionable recommendations.

Step 9: Generate a summary of key insights and recommendations based on the analysis conducted. Clearly articulate findings related to user engagement, demographics, spending behavior, and preferences, and propose actionable recommendations to improve the app's performance and user satisfaction.

Step 10: Share the insights and recommendations with relevant stakeholders using Power BI's sharing and collaboration features. Export visualizations and dashboards as reports or presentations to communicate findings effectively and facilitate decision-making processes.

6. Despite the higher spending and participation in discount deals, married users also account for the majority (65%) of complaints, while single users make up the remaining 35%.

# Recommendations:
Targeted Marketing: Leverage insights into user demographics and preferences to tailor marketing campaigns that specifically target older adults with discount offers. Utilize targeted advertising on the app to promote deals and discounts to this demographic segment, thereby increasing engagement and sales.

Improved Communication: Enhance communication channels within the app to inform older adults about ongoing discounts and promotions. Implement push notifications or email newsletters to alert users about exclusive deals and limited-time offers, thereby increasing user engagement and conversion rates.

Feedback Mechanisms: Implement robust feedback mechanisms within the app to address user complaints effectively. Provide channels for users to voice their concerns and suggestions, and prioritize resolving issues raised by married users to improve overall user satisfaction and retention rates.

Customer Segmentation: Further segment the user base based on preferences and behavior to tailor discounts and promotions more effectively. Analyze spending patterns and feedback data to identify specific needs and pain points of different user segments, allowing for more personalized marketing strategies and service offerings.
